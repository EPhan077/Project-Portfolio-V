# Introduction

This is my Project & Portfolio V project. We are given the opportunity to showcase all current skills gained from our Web Design and Development degree program at [Full Sail University](https://www.fullsail.edu/).

We needed to create an interactive web application which incorporates one or more 3rd party APIs. We are to plan, design, build, and deploy a functional web application.

# Website

I chose to create a web app called Activities To Do. The sole-purpose of the application is to provide you with activities to do based on specific search types (activity type, number of participants, etc.).

## Bootstrap

The bootstrap framework was utilized with a mix of custom CSS. SASS and Gulp was also used for the help of deployment.


## Upcoming Focus

Better browser compatibility. I have yet to learn on how to perform this successfully. The ever challenging task. I hope to hone in on this in future courses.
